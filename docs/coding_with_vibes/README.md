# Coding with V.I.B.E.S.

A documentation methodology for AI-assisted software development.

**V.I.B.E.S.** stands for:

- **Visualize** (30,000ft) — Define the vision and strategic direction
- **Iterate** (15,000ft) — Design system architecture
- **Break** (5,000ft) — Break down features into user stories
- **Execute & Enhance** (Ground Level) — Build and improve
- **Summarize** (Cross-Level) — Document decisions and progress

## Altitude Levels

| Level | Focus | Documents |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 30,000ft | Vision & Strategy | README, PRD, Vision statements |
| 15,000ft | Architecture | System design, API contracts |
| 5,000ft | Features | User stories, coding standards |
| Ground | Implementation | Tasks, types, constants |
| Cross-Level | Knowledge | Decision logs, changelogs |

## Guidelines

- [30k Documentation Guidelines](30k_documentation_guidelines.md) - Vision and strategy docs
- [15k Documentation Guidelines](15k_documentation_guidelines.md) - Architecture and design docs

## How This Project Uses V.I.B.E.S.

The All Day Treats project used this methodology to plan and execute the Astro migration:

- **Vision (30k):** [Migration Vision](../vision/Migration_Vision.md)
- **Architecture (15k):** [Migration Roadmap](../architecture/Migration_Roadmap.md)
- **User Stories (5k):** [astro-migration/](../astro-migration/)

## Quick Reference

### Starting a New Project
1. Define vision (30k) → Create README and PRD
2. Design architecture (15k) → Document system components
3. Break into stories (5k) → Write user stories with acceptance criteria
4. Execute (Ground) → Implement and test

### AI Collaboration Tips

- Start with vision context before technical details
- Use structured formats AI can parse easily
- Maintain links between documentation levels
- Keep docs updated as the project evolves
