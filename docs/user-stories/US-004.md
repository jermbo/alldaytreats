# US-004: Checkout Form UI

**As a** customer
**I want** to enter my information and review my order
**So that** I can complete my purchase

## Problem Statement

Customers need a way to provide their contact and delivery information to complete an order. The checkout form collects this information and displays the order summary for review before submission.

## Requirements

1. Checkout page must display:
   a. Order summary (items, quantities, prices)
   b. Customer information form
   c. Estimated total
   d. Submit button
2. Form fields required:
   a. Full Name (text input, required)
   b. Email Address (email input, required)
   c. Phone Number (tel input, required)
   d. Delivery Address (textarea, required)
   e. Order Notes (textarea, optional)
3. Form must include honeypot field (hidden, for spam prevention)
4. Form must show inline validation errors
5. Form must be mobile-responsive
6. Form must show loading state during submission
7. Form must show success/error states after submission

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have items in my cart **When** I click "Checkout"
   a. **Then** I see the checkout page
   b. **And** I see my order summary with all items
   c. **And** I see the customer information form
   d. **And** I see the estimated total

2. **Given** I am on the checkout page **When** I submit the form with empty required fields
   a. **Then** I see inline error messages for each empty field
   b. **And** the form does not submit

3. **Given** I am on the checkout page **When** I enter an invalid email address
   a. **Then** I see an inline error message for the email field
   b. **And** the form does not submit

4. **Given** I am on the checkout page **When** I submit the form with valid data
   a. **Then** I see a loading state
   b. **And** the submit button is disabled during submission
