# US-003: Cart UI Component

**As a** customer
**I want** to view and manage my cart items
**So that** I can review my order and make changes before checkout

## Problem Statement

Customers need a way to view what's in their cart, modify quantities, remove items, and see the total cost before proceeding to checkout. Without a cart view, users cannot manage their order.

## Requirements

1. Cart should be accessible via cart icon/badge in header
2. Cart can be displayed as slide-out panel or dedicated page
3. Cart must show:
   a. List of items with product name, selected pricing option (count and price), and line item total
   b. Special instructions for each item (if provided, max 250 characters)
   c. Individual item totals (based on selected pricing option)
   d. Subtotal
   e. Estimated total
4. Cart must allow:
   - Remove items from cart
   - Clear entire cart
   - Edit item (opens product details to select different pricing option)
5. Cart must show "Checkout" button when items are present
6. Cart must show empty state when no items are present
7. Cart must be mobile-responsive
8. Each cart item should display the selected pricing option (e.g., "8 for $15")
9. Special instructions must be limited to 250 characters maximum with character counter display

## Acceptance Criteria

   c. **And** items with special instructions display those instructions

2. **Given** I am viewing my cart **When** I click the edit button for an item
   a. **Then** the product details modal opens with the current pricing option selected
   b. **And** any existing special instructions are pre-filled in the text area
   c. **And** I can select a different pricing option or update special instructions
   d. **And** the special instructions textarea shows a character counter (X / 250) and enforces a 250 character limit
   e. **And** when I update and add to cart, the item is updated with the new pricing option and instructions

3. **Given** I am viewing my cart **When** I click the remove button for an item
   a. **Then** the item is removed from the cart
   b. **And** the cart subtotal updates
   c. **And** the cart badge updates
   d. **And** the cart persists to localStorage
