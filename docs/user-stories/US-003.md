# US-003: Cart UI Component

**As a** customer
**I want** to view and manage my cart items
**So that** I can review my order and make changes before checkout

## Problem Statement

Customers need a way to view what's in their cart, modify quantities, remove items, and see the total cost before proceeding to checkout. Without a cart view, users cannot manage their order.

## Requirements

1. Cart should be accessible via cart icon/badge in header
2. Cart can be displayed as slide-out panel or dedicated page
3. Cart must show:
   a. List of items with product name, selected pricing option (count and price), and line item total
   b. Special instructions for each item (if provided)
   c. Individual item totals (based on selected pricing option)
   d. Subtotal
   e. Estimated total
4. Cart must allow:
   - Remove items from cart
   - Clear entire cart
   - Edit item (opens product details to select different pricing option)
5. Cart must show "Checkout" button when items are present
6. Cart must show empty state when no items are present
7. Cart must be mobile-responsive
8. Each cart item should display the selected pricing option (e.g., "8 for $15")

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have items in my cart **When** I click the cart icon in the header
   a. **Then** I see a cart view showing all my items
   b. **And** each item shows name, selected pricing option (e.g., "8ct $15"), and line item total
   c. **And** items with special instructions display those instructions
   d. **And** I can see the subtotal and estimated total

2. **Given** I am viewing my cart **When** I click the edit button for an item
   a. **Then** the product details modal opens with the current pricing option selected
   b. **And** any existing special instructions are pre-filled in the text area
   c. **And** I can select a different pricing option or update special instructions
   d. **And** when I update and add to cart, the item is updated with the new pricing option and instructions

3. **Given** I am viewing my cart **When** I click the remove button for an item
   a. **Then** the item is removed from the cart
   b. **And** the cart subtotal updates
   c. **And** the cart badge updates
   d. **And** the cart persists to localStorage

4. **Given** my cart is empty **When** I view the cart
   a. **Then** I see an empty state message
   b. **And** the checkout button is not shown
