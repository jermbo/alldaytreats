# US-003: Cart UI Component

**As a** customer
**I want** to view and manage my cart items
**So that** I can review my order and make changes before checkout

## Problem Statement

Customers need a way to view what's in their cart, modify quantities, remove items, and see the total cost before proceeding to checkout. Without a cart view, users cannot manage their order.

## Requirements

1. Cart should be accessible via cart icon/badge in header
2. Cart can be displayed as slide-out panel or dedicated page
3. Cart must show:
   a. List of items with product name, quantity, and price
   b. Individual item totals
   c. Subtotal
   d. Estimated total
4. Cart must allow:
   - Increase/decrease quantity for each item
   - Remove items from cart
   - Clear entire cart
5. Cart must show "Checkout" button when items are present
6. Cart must show empty state when no items are present
7. Cart must be mobile-responsive

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have items in my cart **When** I click the cart icon in the header
   a. **Then** I see a cart view showing all my items
   b. **And** each item shows name, quantity, and price
   c. **And** I can see the subtotal and estimated total

2. **Given** I am viewing my cart **When** I click the increase quantity button for an item
   a. **Then** the quantity increases by **1**
   b. **And** the item total updates
   c. **And** the cart subtotal updates
   d. **And** the cart persists to localStorage

3. **Given** I am viewing my cart **When** I click the remove button for an item
   a. **Then** the item is removed from the cart
   b. **And** the cart subtotal updates
   c. **And** the cart badge updates
   d. **And** the cart persists to localStorage

4. **Given** my cart is empty **When** I view the cart
   a. **Then** I see an empty state message
   b. **And** the checkout button is not shown
