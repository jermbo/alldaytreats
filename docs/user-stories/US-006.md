# US-006: Order Submission Service (Client-Side)

**As a** customer
**I want** my order to be submitted when I complete the checkout form
**So that** the business receives my order

## Problem Statement

After completing the checkout form, the order data needs to be sent to the serverless function for processing. This service handles the communication between the frontend and backend, including error handling and retries.

## Requirements

1. Format order data according to Order interface from architecture
2. Generate unique order ID (UUID or timestamp-based)
3. Include timestamp in ISO 8601 format
4. Send POST request to serverless function endpoint
5. Handle network errors with retry logic (max 2 retries, exponential backoff)
6. Handle validation errors from server
7. Handle rate limiting errors from server
8. Handle server errors gracefully
9. Show appropriate user feedback for each error type

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have completed the checkout form with valid data **When** I click submit
   a. **Then** the order data is formatted as JSON
   b. **And** a POST request is sent to the serverless function endpoint
   c. **And** the order includes all required fields (id, timestamp, customer, items, totals)

2. **Given** the network request fails **When** the order submission is attempted
   a. **Then** the request is retried up to **2** times with exponential backoff
   b. **And** if all retries fail, I see a user-friendly error message
   c. **And** I see contact information as a fallback

3. **Given** the server returns a validation error **When** the order submission is attempted
   a. **Then** I see specific error messages for invalid fields
   b. **And** the form highlights the problematic fields

4. **Given** the server returns a rate limit error **When** the order submission is attempted
   a. **Then** I see a message explaining the rate limit
   b. **And** I see when I can try again

## Definition of Done

- Code meets project standards
- Peer reviewed and approved
- Documentation updated
- Retry logic tested
- All error scenarios handled
- Network failures handled gracefully
