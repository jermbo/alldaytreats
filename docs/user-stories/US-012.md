# US-012: Email Notification Service

**As a** business owner
**I want** to receive email notifications for new orders
**So that** I am immediately aware of new orders

## Problem Statement

The business owner needs immediate notification when a new order is placed. Email notifications ensure orders are not missed and can be processed quickly.

## Requirements

1. Integrate with email service (SendGrid, Resend, or similar)
2. Format order data into readable email
3. Include order summary (items, quantities, prices)
4. Include customer information (name, email, phone, address)
5. Include order notes if provided
6. Send email to business owner's email address
7. Handle email service errors gracefully
8. Retry failed sends (max 2 retries)
9. Log email sends and errors

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a valid order is submitted **When** the serverless function processes it
   a. **Then** an email is sent to the business owner
   b. **And** the email contains all order information
   c. **And** the email is formatted for easy reading

2. **Given** the email service returns an error **When** the serverless function tries to send the email
   a. **Then** the send is retried up to **2** times
   b. **And** if all retries fail, an error is logged
   c. **And** the order is still saved to Google Sheets

3. **Given** multiple orders are submitted **When** they are processed
   a. **Then** separate emails are sent for each order
   b. **And** each email contains the correct order information
