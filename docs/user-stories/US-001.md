# US-001: Product Details and Add to Cart Functionality

**As a** customer
**I want** to view product details with pricing options and add items to my cart
**So that** I can select the quantity and price that fits my needs before adding to my order

## Problem Statement

Customers need a way to view product details and select from available pricing options before adding items to their cart. Each product has multiple pricing tiers based on quantity (e.g., 6 for $10, 8 for $15, 12 for $20). Currently, there is no mechanism to view these options or add products with specific pricing selections to the cart.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a product in the menu should open a product details modal
2. Modal must be displayed as an overlay with blurred background
3. Modal header must include:
   a. Product name displayed in uppercase on the left
   b. Close button (X icon) on the right
4. Modal body must display in order:
   a. Large product image
   b. Product description text
   c. "Select Quantity" section with:
   - Label "Select Quantity"
   - Button/card options for each pricing option
   - Each option displays format: "{count}ct ${price}" (e.g., "6ct $12", "8ct $17", "12ct $27")
   - Selected option must have a visible border highlight (light blue)
   - Unselected options have dark background with light text
     d. "Special Instructions (optional)" section with:
   - Label "Special Instructions (optional)"
   - Text area input field
   - Placeholder text: "Colors, themes, or special requests..."
     e. "Add to Cart" button at the bottom:
   - Full-width button
   - Displays dynamic text: "Add to Cart - ${selectedPrice}"
   - Includes checkmark icon
   - Bright cyan-blue color scheme
   - Disabled state until pricing option is selected
5. Modal must use dark theme (dark grey/black background with light text)
6. User must select a pricing option before adding to cart
7. When "Add to Cart" is clicked, the product should be added with:
   a. Selected pricing option (count and price)
   b. Product ID and name
   c. Special instructions (if provided)
8. Cart badge should update to show new item count
9. User should receive visual feedback that item was added (animation, toast, or cart slide-out)
10. Modal should close after successful add to cart
11. Modal should close when clicking the X button or clicking outside the modal

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am viewing the product menu **When** I click on a product
   a. **Then** a product details modal opens as an overlay with blurred background
   b. **And** the modal displays the product name in uppercase, product image, and description
   c. **And** I can see all available pricing options as buttons/cards (e.g., "6ct $12", "8ct $17", "12ct $27")
   d. **And** I can see a "Special Instructions (optional)" text area
   e. **And** the "Add to Cart" button shows the format "Add to Cart - $0" and is disabled until I select a pricing option

2. **Given** I am viewing the product details modal **When** I select a pricing option (e.g., "12ct $27")
   a. **Then** the selected option is visually highlighted with a light blue border
   b. **And** the "Add to Cart" button text updates to show the selected price (e.g., "Add to Cart - $27")
   c. **And** the "Add to Cart" button becomes enabled

3. **Given** I have selected a pricing option **When** I optionally enter special instructions and click "Add to Cart"
   a. **Then** the product is added to my cart with the selected count, price, and special instructions
   b. **And** the cart badge in the header shows the updated item count
   c. **And** I see visual feedback confirming the item was added
   d. **And** the modal closes

4. **Given** I am viewing the product details modal **When** I click the X button or click outside the modal
   a. **Then** the modal closes without adding anything to the cart

5. **Given** I add the same product with the same pricing option to cart again **When** I click "Add to Cart"
   a. **Then** a new line item is added to the cart (or quantity increases, depending on cart logic)
