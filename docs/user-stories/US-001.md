# US-001: Add to Cart Functionality

**As a** customer
**I want** to add products to my cart from the product menu
**So that** I can build my order before checkout

## Problem Statement

Customers need a way to select products they want to order. Currently, there is no mechanism to collect items for purchase. This story enables the fundamental cart functionality by allowing users to add products to their cart.

## Requirements

1. Add "Add to Cart" button to each product in the menu
2. Button should be visible and accessible on all device sizes
3. When clicked, product should be added to cart with default quantity of 1
4. Cart badge should update to show new item count
5. User should receive visual feedback that item was added (animation, toast, or cart slide-out)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am viewing the product menu **When** I click "Add to Cart" on a product
   a. **Then** the product is added to my cart with quantity **1**
   b. **And** the cart badge in the header shows the updated item count
   c. **And** I see visual feedback confirming the item was added

2. **Given** I add the same product to cart again **When** I click "Add to Cart" on that product
   a. **Then** the quantity for that product increases by **1**
   b. **And** the cart badge reflects the total item count
