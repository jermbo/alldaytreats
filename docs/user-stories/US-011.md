# US-011: Google Sheets Integration

**As a** business owner
**I want** orders to be automatically saved to a Google Sheet
**So that** I can track and manage orders easily

## Problem Statement

Orders need to be stored in a structured format that the business owner can easily access and manage. Google Sheets provides a familiar interface for viewing, filtering, and managing orders without requiring a custom admin interface.

## Requirements

1. Authenticate with Google Sheets API using service account or API key
2. Append order data as new row to spreadsheet
3. Include all order fields: timestamp, order ID, customer info, items, totals, notes
4. Handle API errors gracefully
5. Retry failed writes (max 2 retries)
6. Log successful writes and errors

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a valid order is submitted **When** the serverless function processes it
   a. **Then** a new row is appended to the Google Sheet
   b. **And** the row contains all order data in the correct columns
   c. **And** the timestamp is in ISO **8601** format

2. **Given** the Google Sheets API returns an error **When** the serverless function tries to write the order
   a. **Then** the write is retried up to **2** times
   b. **And** if all retries fail, an error is logged
   c. **And** the function continues to send email notification

3. **Given** multiple orders are submitted **When** they are processed
   a. **Then** each order appears as a separate row in the Google Sheet
   b. **And** rows are appended in chronological order

## Definition of Done

- Code meets project standards
- Peer reviewed and approved
- Documentation updated
- Google Sheets API integration tested
- Error handling tested
