# US-013: Order Submission Success and Error Handling

**As a** customer
**I want** clear feedback when my order is submitted
**So that** I know if my order was successful or if I need to try again

## Problem Statement

Users need clear, actionable feedback after submitting an order. Success states confirm the order was received, while error states provide guidance on what went wrong and how to proceed.

## Requirements

1. Show success message when order is submitted successfully
2. Show order ID in success message
3. Clear cart after successful submission
4. Show error messages for different error types (network, validation, rate limit, server)
5. Provide contact information as fallback for errors
6. Allow user to retry submission for network errors
7. Show appropriate messaging for rate limit errors

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** my order is submitted successfully **When** I receive the success response
   a. **Then** I see a success message
   b. **And** the message includes my order ID
   c. **And** my cart is cleared
   d. **And** I have an option to return to the menu

2. **Given** my order submission fails due to network error **When** the error occurs
   a. **Then** I see a user-friendly error message
   b. **And** I see a retry button
   c. **And** I see contact information as a fallback

3. **Given** my order submission fails due to rate limiting **When** the error occurs
   a. **Then** I see a message explaining the rate limit
   b. **And** I see when I can try again
   c. **And** I see contact information

4. **Given** my order submission fails due to server error **When** the error occurs
   a. **Then** I see a generic error message
   b. **And** I see contact information
   c. **And** no technical details are exposed
