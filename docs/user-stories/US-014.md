# US-014: Cart Badge/Indicator in Header

**As a** customer
**I want** to see how many items are in my cart at all times
**So that** I know my cart status without opening it

## Problem Statement

Users need a visual indicator of their cart contents at all times. A cart badge in the header provides immediate visibility into cart status without requiring users to open the cart.

## Requirements

1. Display cart icon/badge in header
2. Show item count badge on cart icon
3. Update badge count in real-time as items are added/removed
4. Hide badge when cart is empty
5. Make cart icon clickable to open cart
6. Ensure badge is visible and accessible on all device sizes

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have items in my cart **When** I view the header
   a. **Then** I see a cart icon with a badge showing the item count
   b. **And** the badge number matches the total number of items in my cart

2. **Given** I add an item to my cart **When** the item is added
   a. **Then** the cart badge updates immediately
   b. **And** the badge shows the new count

3. **Given** my cart is empty **When** I view the header
   a. **Then** I see the cart icon
   b. **And** the badge is hidden

4. **Given** I click the cart icon **When** I click it
   a. **Then** the cart view opens (slide-out or page)
