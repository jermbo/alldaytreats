# All Day Treats

A minimal, static website for All Day Treats—a local business specializing in handcrafted candy-coated fruits, chocolate-covered treats, and custom party platters.

## Purpose

This website serves as a digital brochure that showcases All Day Treats' product offerings. It enables customers to discover products, view pricing, and easily contact the business to place custom orders. The site supports organic growth through social media and word-of-mouth marketing.

## What This Project Is

- **A Product Showcase**: Visual menu displaying candy-coated fruits, chocolate-covered treats, and party platters
- **A Contact Hub**: Easy access to email and Instagram for order inquiries
- **A Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized for customers discovering the business through social media
- **A Static Website**: Zero backend, zero databases, zero monthly bills

## What This Project Is Not

- An e-commerce platform (no online ordering or payment processing)
- A content management system (product updates require code changes)
- A backend service (no APIs, databases, or server-side logic)

## Key Features

- **Product Menu**: Displays all treat categories with images, descriptions, and starting prices
- **Category Filtering**: Filter products by "All Treats", "Candy Coated", "Chocolate Covered", or "Platters"
- **Contact Integration**: Direct links to email and Instagram for order inquiries
- **Order Information**: Clear explanation of ordering process, deposits, and payment methods
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach optimized for social media traffic
- **Performance**: Fast loading, optimized for mobile networks

## Technology Approach

The project uses a minimal technology stack to maintain zero monthly operational costs:

- Static site hosting (no backend services)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no heavy frameworks)
- Modern CSS with custom properties
- View Transitions API for smooth animations

## Future Enhancements

Planned features (not yet implemented):

- Simple "Add to Cart" functionality
- Email-based order submission
- Client-side cart that generates order summaries

These features will be implemented without adding backend services or monthly costs. See [Ordering System Architecture](docs/architecture/ordering-system.md) for detailed design.
